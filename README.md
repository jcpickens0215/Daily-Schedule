# Daily-Schedule

## Description
A planner you can use to schedule your work day. It shows the current day, and has a table of hours from 9 AM to 5 PM. The rows are color coded based on whether the hour has passed, is the current hour, or the hour is in the future.

### Usage
To enter an event, simply click on the box under the hour you want, and type in what you'll be doing. Then click the save button (to the right of the text box) to save the event to your local storage. You'll know that the event has been saved if the _"Saved!"_ tooltip appears.

## Background
I wanted some practice with Bootstrap and jQuery, both of which I learned to help accelerate my web development. Bootstrap is used on the HTML, and jQuery is used to grab elements in the JS.
